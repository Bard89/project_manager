 maybe I wanna have a link to the new page in my index page
 links are similiar to the redirect functionality in principle

 and also to the show page of the project
 when I don't have to use just the string as a visible link
<%

<h1>All the projects </h1>
<%= link_to "Create a new project", new_project_path %> 
<% @projects.each do |project| %>
    <p><%= link_to project.title, project_path(project)%> <%= project.position%></p>
<% end %>
