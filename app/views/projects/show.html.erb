  we gonna add link to go back, edit and destroy

  by defauls link_to is a get method, delete is delete method, so I have to specify it
  the one before path is always the helper, so the first one in the rails routes

  I also wanna ask the user if he wants to delete the project -> data: ...
<%

<h1>Concrete one project </h1>
<p>
    <strong>Project title:</strong>
    <%= @project.title%> 
</p>
<p>  
    <strong>Position: </strong>
    <%= @project.position %>
</p>  

<p>
    <strong>Tasks of my project:</strong>
    <% @project.tasks.each do |task|%>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Task: </strong> <%= task.title%></p>
    <p><strong>Task description: </strong> <%= task.description%></p>
    <br>
    <% end %>
</p>
