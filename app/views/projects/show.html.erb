  we gonna add link to go back, edit and destroy

  by defauls link_to is a get method, delete is delete method, so I have to specify it
  the one before path is always the helper, so the first one in the rails routes

  I also wanna ask the user if he wants to delete the project -> data: ...
<%

<h1>Concrete one project </h1>
<p><%= @project.title%>   <%= @project.position %></p>  
<%= link_to 'back', projects_path %> 
<%= link_to 'edit', edit_project_path(@project) %> 
<%= link_to 'delete', project_path(@project), method: :delete, data: {confirm: "Are ty jsi you sure to delete? That's very final decisin you know ... 🧐 "} %>
